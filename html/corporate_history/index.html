                            <h5>UKPG was founded in 1986</h5>
                            <p>UKPG was founded in 1986 by Scott. Prior to this, Scott had worked for 11 years at the British Institute of Finance. He registered UKPG by virtue of accumulated contacts and experience of the 11 years.</p>
                            <p>In the medium-term of establishment, UKPG has gradually developed into a diversified financial group engaged in fund management, Banking and investment financing.</p>

                            <h5>Preliminarily shaped in 2003</h5>
                            <p>At the financial industry reception held by UKPG in 2003, Marvin met a financial industry leader and exposed to forex luckily. In a very long time Marvin was amazed at the considerable and stable income brought by forex, so he recommended forex to Scott, the founder of UKPG, and found that as a referrer, Marvin himself gained a portion of Scott’s profits while Scott gained returns.</p>
                            <p>Once, Scott accidentally revealed that he was investing forex when he was communicating with several offline customers such as Larry. This greatly intrigued the customers, of course, several regular customers from PHION became Scott’s subordinate members. Over time, Scott and a few regular customers led by Larry formed a closed forex investment circle.</p>

                            <h5>Lay the foundation in 2005</h5>
                            <p>After two years, Scott and Larry was surprised to find that within two years, the benefits brought by the forex was far higher than the fund investment, thus it was clear that the value of forex was immeasurable. Scott made a prompt decision to establish a forex investment team led by a few regular customers on one hand, and hold a board meeting as fast as possible to redesign the group’s development direction of forex on the other hand.</p>
                            <p>Scott found a drawback soon: in the process of forex transactions, the differences of currencies among countries increased the procedures for the conversion of the corresponding currency, which made forex transactions very complicated. This problem exists not only in PHION, but also in the general global forex investment industry. Scott finally decided to use bitcoin as a means of trading, which was also a fundamental solution to the problem of cumbersome forex transactions as a virtual currency in circulation all over the world. And this wise decision laid the foundation for the development of PHION.</p>
